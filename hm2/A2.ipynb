    "\n",
    "## **Due: Oct 11th (Friday), 2024, 11:59pm (Pacific Time)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Jupyter notebook assignment will often have 3 elements: written answers, code answers, and quiz answers. For written answers, you may insert images of your handwritten work in code cells, or write your answers in markdown and LaTeX. For quiz answers, your `record.txt` file will record your answer choices in the quiz modules for submission. Both your quiz answers and code answers will be autograded on Gradescope. This assignment does not have the quiz portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all elements, DO NOT MODIFY THE CELLS. Put your answers **only** in the answer cells given, and **do not delete cells**. If you fail to follow these instructions, you will lose points on your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to show the steps of your solution for every question to receive credit, not just the final answer. You may search information online but you will need to write code/find solutions to answer the questions yourself. You will submit your .ipynb file and record.txt to gradescope when you are finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Late Policy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "5% reduction for the first day and 10% reduction afterwards for every extra day past due.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Include Your Math Written Answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use markdowns' include image functionality (recommended) or $\\LaTeX$ in markdown to submit your written responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Include Images (recommended)\n",
    "If you are still getting familiar with using LaTeX, handwrite the response on paper or the stylus. Take a picture or screenshot of your answer, and include that image in the Jupyter Notebook. Be sure to include that image in the `\\imgs` directory. Let's say you have your Q1 response saved as `imgs/Q1.png`; the markdown syntax to include that image is `![Q1](imgs/Q1.png)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $\\LaTeX$\n",
    "[Here is a fantastic tutorial from CalTech about using $\\LaTeX$ in Jupyter Notebook.](http://chebe163.caltech.edu/2018w/handouts/intro_to_latex.html). You could also find various $\\LaTeX$ tutorials and cheat sheets online.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notice\n",
    "\n",
    "You must check both submission output on the gradescope (`Assignment 2 - Notebook` and `Assignment 2 - Manual Grading`) correctly reflects your work and responses. If you notice inconsistencies between your notebook and the Manual Grading portion, you need to make a Piazza post, and we can help you with that."
